Title: Facilitate Linear Mixed-Effects Models reduction
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Julian Selke
Maintainer: Julian Selke <julianselke@web.de>
Description: The <b>CherryModels</b> package facilitates computing thousands of linear mixed-effects models to determine the model that best explains your data. To this end, all combinations of fixed effects with and without interaction are generated and computed with `lmerTest::lmer()`. Subsequently, a step-wise model reduction is performed on every model with `lmerTest::step()`.
